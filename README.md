# Cricket-Analytics
This is my final project for the class Gov-1005 (Data) taught by David Kane. In the project, I use ball-by-ball data from limited overs cricket matches played in the past 13 years to look at trends in individual and team performances.  

The data for the project is sourced from cricsheet.org and has been cleaned and formatted by me. The code for the data gathering process is included in the rmd file in the repo.
